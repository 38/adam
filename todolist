Current: Builtin Class Support, Exception Classes
	Some modifies is needed because if we introduce the built-in class, the address slot which contains object instance will become subject to 
	store modification. But currently we do not allow frame diff to do this. 

	In addition, we need to translate address in the built-in classes


1. add age to set, so that we can distinguish the old value and new value. so that if we can make sure this refernce is acutally to newly created one, 
we can override.
2. int as an object & constant pool
